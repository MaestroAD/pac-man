# Call to Devs
It is important to note that the Ghost movement is primitive as it is based on random movement. Therefore, if you would like to improve the difficulty of the game, please modify [ghostMoves.js](https://github.com/akshayd261/pac-man/blob/master/ghostMoves.js) to make more spooky ghost movement.
